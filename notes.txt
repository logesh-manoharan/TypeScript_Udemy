TypeScript = Typescript is super set of JavaScript.

Takes JavaScript and add more advantages by creating several new features.

Browser doesn't execute Typescript.

Node JS is also didn't execute.

Seperate Compiler which is very strong will convert the typescript into the JavaScript.

TypeScript is converted into JavaScript and executed in all the environments.

Command to install the TYPESCRIPT 

    $ npm install -g typescript

Main Advantage:

    It allows the developers to write a very clear and error less code.

    We can avoid many unwanted and unnecessary errors.

    Non JavaScript features like Interfaces and Generics

    Meta-Programming Features like Decorators

    Rich Configuration options (We can make our own compiler)

        TypeScript                                  JavaScript

        eg:                                         eg:

        function add (n1: number, n2: number) {     function add (n1, n2) {
            return n1 + n2;                             if (typeof n1 !== 'number' || typeof n2 !== 'number') {
        }                                                   return new Error("Input should be a number !!");
                                                        }
                                                        return n1 + n2;
                                                    }



        Core Types (of TYPES):
                                SPECIALITIES
            number  -               ---
            string  -               ---
            boolean -               ---
            object  -               ---
            Array   - it contains 'any' type i.e. We can store data in array with different data types
            tuples  - JS doesn't contains it. (Fixed length array)
            enum    - JS doesn't contains it. (To define the GLOBAL CONSTANTS)
